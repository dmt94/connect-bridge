#### Key Learning and Takeaways
___

##### React Hooks
  - React Hooks are a powerful tool for managing state and side effects in functional components

##### Reusable Components
  - Creating reusable components is important for keeping the codebase organized and maintainable. I was able to easily debug and update my code. Plus, I see the benefit of reusing components across different parts of the application, which can save a lot of time and effort in the long run for future projects.

- State management was extremely helpful. ```useState``` was used to manage component-level state, and ```useEffect``` handled side effects like fetching data from the backend.
